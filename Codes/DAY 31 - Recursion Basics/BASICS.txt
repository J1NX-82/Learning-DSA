Recursion uses an in-built stack that storesrecursive calls.
Hence, the number of recursive calls must be as small as possible to avoid memory-overflow. 
If the number of recursion calls exceeded the maximum permissible amount, therecursion depth*will be exceeded. 
This condition is calledstack overflow.
